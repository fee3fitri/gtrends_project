# gTrends Project


## Background
gTrends is an app where users can find Google trends metrics by keyword. Search bar on the homepage will allow users to input their keyword. After users click the search button, an animated line chart and map will be provided. On the map, users are able to highlight the regions and see metrics of the highlighted region. Underneath the line chart, keywords related to the trends results will be provided.


## Functionality & MVPs
In gTrends, users will be able to:
-	find the keyword trends metrics
-	interact with the line chart which represents the trends over period of time
-	interact with the map which represents the trends by the region
-	see daily keyword trends
-	see related keyword search
-	go to Google search results when clicking the link on the keyword

In addition, this project will include:
-	An About modal describing the functionality of this app
-	A production README

-	HTML5
-	CSS3
-	Vanilla JS
-	Google Trends API (or using CSV file as a data source)
-	GeoChart API
-	Chart.js


## Implementation Timeline
### Friday Afternoon & Weekend
Setup project, including getting webpack up and running. Setup Google Trends API and spend time getting comfortable with Chart.js. Get the line chart shown on the project. Or in case if the API doesnâ€™t work, try to setup the data source in CSV file and connect it to the project through JavaScript.

### Monday
Dedicate this day toward setting up the map to be able to interact with user. Get the map shown on the project.

### Tuesday
Implementing user control and focus on styling.

### Wednesday
Adding related keyword trends on the map metrics. If time allows, start working on bonuses.

### Thursday Morning
Deploy to GitHub pages. If time allows, rewrite this proposal as a production README.


## Bonuses
-	Adding animated counter to show Googgle traffic per minute
